1                                    Implicatures   (20   points) 
1.1                   Calculating   Implicatures   (10   points) Below   you   will   find   two   short   dialogues, followed   by   an   implicature   that   could   be   generated   by   each   dialogue.   Your   job   is   to calculate   how   the   implicature arises   using Gricean   reasoning.   Formulate   your calculations   from   the   perspective   of   speaker   (a).
1.1.1            Dialogue   1 
(1)          Context:    Speaker   A is friends   with   both   speaker   B,   and   their   sibling,   Sam.    The two   siblings   are    both   students.   Speaker A   is asking about their semester.
a.            Which   courses   are   you   and   Sam   taking   this   term?
b.          I’m   taking   several   psychology   and   linguistics   courses.   Sam   has   at   least   three   courses.
Implicature: (B) does   not   know   which   courses   Sam   is   taking.
1.1.2            Dialogue   2 
(2)          Context:    Speaker B   is   tired,   and   walking home   from   work.    They   pass   through   a   busy   intersection,   where   an   energetic   public salesperson   (speaker A)   with a   clipboard   begins   to   follow   them and ask questions.
a.          Nice   sweater!   You   seem   like   a   fashionable   person.   Have   you   heard   about   the   new   store   opening   up a   few   blocks   from   here?   I   have   coupons   for   20%   off   on   shoes!   Where   do   you   live?
b.            I   live   in   Antarctica.
Implicature: B   wants   the   salesperson   to   leave   them   alone.
1.2                        Implicature   or   not?      (10   points) Below   are   five sentences, followed   by   an inference.   Determine   whether or   not   this inference is an implicature of   the   sentence   by   performing   a   test   and   evaluating   the   results.    Clearly   state   what   test   you   are   performing,   and   what   the   conclusion   is.
(3)            a.            Some   of   my   friends   are   vegetarian.
b. Inference:   not   all   of   my   friends   are   vegetarian.
(4)          a.             Brìghde   started   teaching   Gaelic   this   year.
b. Inference:   Brìghde   didn’t   teach   Gaelic   before.
(5)          a.             Dalton   called   his   mother   and   drive   back   to   the   reservation.
b. Inference:   Dalton   called   his   mother   first,   and   then   drove   back,   in   that   order.
(6)          a.             I   know   Chim   came   home   some   time   late – must   have   been   after   midnight.
b. Inference:   The   speaker   does   not   know   exactly   when   Chim   returned.
(7)          a.             My   mother   drove   my   car   to   the   airport   because   hers   broke   down.
b. Inference:My   mother   drove   to   the   airport.
2                                    Entailments   and   Presuppositions   (12   points) For   the   following   pairs   of   sentences, decide   whether   the   second   sentence   is   an   entailment   of   the   first,   or   is   a presupposition,   or   whether   there   is   no   relation.    Support   your   answer   by   performing   test(s),   evaluating   the results, and   describing   the   conclusions.   When   there   is   no   logical   relation   between   two   sentences,   make   sure you   demonstrate   this   with   entailment   tests   from   both   directions.    When   you   can   demonstrate   entailment   or presupposition, focus on showing the   the   second   sentence   is   an   entailment   or   presupposition   of   the   first   sentence.

Your   job   is   to   identify, descriptively,   the   illocutionary force   of   these   sentences   if   uttered   in   the   real   world, and   then   to   classify   this   illocutionary   force   under   one   of Searle’s   classes   of   illocutionary   acts.

代做程序编程语言                   Truth   Tables   (18   points) 
4.1                        Filling   in   Truth   Tables   (4pts) 
In   the   following   truth   table,   there   are   missing   values,   represented   by   __.    Fill   these   in   to   complete   the   truth table.Note:   in   this   presentation, the   value   of   an   expression   (e.g.    (p   → r) )   appears   under   the   connective,   (e.g.   →   ).   You   can   consider   this   to   be   a   column   containing   that   whole   expression.    For   negation   of   a   proposition (e.g.      →r),   the   value   appears   under   the   connective   (e.g.      →)   as   well.    As   these   columns   are   sub-parts   of the   larger   expression, they will   appear   next to   or   inside   of   larger   expressions, with the   truth   value   of   the   entire   formula   being   represented   under   the   highest-level   connective,   in   the   centre   of   the   table.    Below,   this   is   the biconditional.

4.2                        Identifying   Errors   in   Truth   Tables   (4   points) In   the   following   truth   table,   there   are   several   errors.    Identify   these   errors,   and   state   what   the   correct   value should be.   This can be done by circling or   crossing   out   the   incorrect value   and   writing   the   correct   one   near   it,   or   on   the   side   connected   by   an   arrow.    Rows   have   also   been   numbered,   so   alternatively,   you   can   answer   descriptively   in   text   in   the   following   way, for   example:   “In   row   4,   the   value   for   (p   Λ r) should   be   F”Note:   in   this   presentation, the   value   of   an   expression   (e.g.    (p → r) ) appears   under   the   connective,   (e.g.   →   ).   You   can   consider this   to   be   a   column   containing   that   whole   expression.   For   negation   of   a   proposition   (e.g.   ¬r), the   value   appears   under   the   connective (e.g.   ¬) as   well.   As   these   columns   are   sub-parts   of   the   larger   expression, they   will   appear   next   to   or   inside   of   larger   expressions, with the truth value of   the entire formula being represented   under the   highest-level   connective,   in   the   centre   of   the   table.

4.3                   Using   Truth   Tables   to   identify   Equivalence   (10   points) 
Are   the   following   two   formulas   equivalent?
(19)            a.             (pΛr)∨¬(rΛq)
b.            (¬p∨¬q)∨(¬p∨¬r)To   answer   this   question, first   fill   in   the   final   two   columns   of   the   truth   table   below.   (The   beginning   of   the truth   table   with   some   relevant   sub-formulas   has   been   provided   for   you.)   Then,   state   clearly   in   written   form. whether   or   not   the   two   formulas   in   (19)   are   equivalent,   and   identify   any   /   which   valuation   rows   in   the   table that   lead   you   to   this   conclusion.

5.2.3 
Lemon   has   started   scratching   people.    Write   a   definition   for   a   “scratch” relation   where   Lemon   scratches   at least   three   other   individuals.
